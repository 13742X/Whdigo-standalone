Offline Ultra Secure Password Repo

Whdigo is an offline password manager. It does not interact with a server and should be run offline (no internet connection).
Apps and Sign On credentials are mapped together. 
An offline file should be saved (either 1 or more secure are 2 files which are bother needed to rebuild the repo).

One file
All javascript and css is embedded in one file - index.html.
If you need to run as a PWA you will need to download the manifest.json and the service worker sw.js along with the icons.
